On EOSIO based blockchains, to be able to deploy and then interact with a smart contract via its implemented actions it needs to be backed up by resources allocated on the account where the smart contract is deployed to. The three resource types an EOSIO smart contract developer needs to know about are RAM, CPU and NET. You can __stake__ CPU and NET and you can __buy__ RAM. You will also find that staking/unstaking is at times referred to as delegating/undelegating. The economics of staking is also to provably commit to a promise that you'll hold the staked tokens, either for NET or CPU, for a pre-established period of time, in spite of inflation caused by minting new tokens in order to reward BPs for their services every 24 hours.
